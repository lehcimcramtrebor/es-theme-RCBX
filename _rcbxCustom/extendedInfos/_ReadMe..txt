Here you can duplicate "template.xml" file, rename it by theme name, example: "megadrive.xml" or "snes.xml"
and add missing release dates and choose type of system, for examples :

- If declared like a port this will display only
release date (if declared) and last played date

- If declared like pinball this will replace all "games" terms by "tables"

etc.. see what you can do in files.
