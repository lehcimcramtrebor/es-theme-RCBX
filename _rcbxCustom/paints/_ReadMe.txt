Here you can place ".jpg" or ".png" files named by theme, examples: "snes.jpg", "megadrive.jpg" etc..

You can put an image named "default.jpg" or "default.png" to use one default image on all theme.

Use "system.jpg" or png to use one default image for all systems views.

Use "gamelist.jpg" or png to use one default image for all gamelists.

You can cumulate default images and system named images, or simply use only default images.

This will use your files as system view wall paint (aligned on left screen, full height and shade on right)
