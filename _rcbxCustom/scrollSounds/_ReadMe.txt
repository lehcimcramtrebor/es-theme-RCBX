Here you can place only 4 files to change scroll sounds by view.

"system.wav" for system carousel scroll sound,
"gamelist.wav" for basic and detailed gamelist scroll sound,
"grid.wav" for grid scroll sound and
"gamecarousel.wav" for game carousel scroll sound.


You can also place files by system name, so it will be play only in gamelist views (basic,detailed,grid,gamecarousel)
but each system can have his own, examples:

"megadrive.wav", "snes.wav" etc..

For general example, you can use the 4 files to customize all and both system specific files, experiment..
